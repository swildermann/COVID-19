# COVID-19
This is a public accessible dataset for COVID-19. We made the data for Germany from the Robert Koch Insititute and worldwide data from Johns Hopkins CSSE and European Centre for Disease Prevention available on a daily base with daily updates.

## Robert Koch Institute (RKI) - dataset for Germany
As the Robert Koch Institute does not publish data in a computer consumable format, we decided to grab the information from their website and make this dataset public available. 

This dataset is going to be updated daily, as soon as the information from the Robert Koch Institute is available.

<b>UPDATE:</b> "ECDC switched to a weekly reporting schedule for the COVID-19 situation worldwide and in the EU/EEA and the UK on 17 December 2020.

ECDCâ€™s decision to discontinue daily data collection is based on the fact that the daily number of cases is frequently subject to retrospective corrections, delays in reporting and/or clustered reporting of data for several days. Consequently, day to day variations in the number of cases does not constitute a valid basis for policy decisions. ECDC continues to monitor events and reports of concern through its epidemic intelligence, and will disseminate important information arising from this activity as and when relevant to inform public health action.

Hence, all daily updates have been discontinued from 14 December. "
