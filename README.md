# COVID-19
public accessible data for COVID-19 in Germany

## RKI
As the Robert Koch Institute does not publish data in a computer consumable format, we decided to grab the information from their website and make this dataset public available. 

This dataset is going to be updated daily, as soon as the information from the Robert Koch Institute is available.
